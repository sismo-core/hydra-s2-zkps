Hydra-S2 is an upgrade of the [Hydra-S1](https://github.com/sismo-core/hydra-s1-zkps) Zero-Knowledge Proving Scheme. The major update concerns the addition of the notion of a vault Identifier (vaultId) used in zkConnect.

Additionally, while Hydra-S1 only generates ZK Proofs from a Merkle tree storing groups of accounts with values (e.g group of ENS DAO voters where the account value is the number of votes), Hydra-S2 has a more modular approach. It is possible to only verify specific elements such as the Proof of Ownerships, the vaultId or only the inclusion of a specific account in a group for example.  

Therefore, Hydra-S2 enables users to generate ZK proofs for the following statements:
- Ownerships (optional): They own two accounts, a source account and a destination account. (the two are optional, it is possible to only verify the ownership of a single account, or neither of the two)
- Account inclusion (optional): Their source account is part of a group (we can choose to not check the Merkle proof)
- Account value (optional): Their source account holds a specific value 
- Vault Identifier Generation (optional): The vaultIdentifier is generated deterministically from the vault secret and vaultNamespace (an appId), and can be stored by apps to identify the owner of a specific vault for a specific application.
- Proof Identifier Generation (optional): The proofIdentifier is generated deterministically from the source account and a requestIdentifier. Proof verifiers can store it to ensure that only one ZK proof per account per requestIdentifier is accepted. A request identifier is deterministically generated from an appId, a groupId, a groupTimestamp and a namespace.

You can see additional details in the [Hydra-S2 documentation](https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/technical-concepts/hydra-zk-proving-schemes/hydra-s2).

## Circuits and Package

Hydra-S2 Proving Scheme was developed using [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) and [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs). This repo contains the circuits.

It outputs an off-chain prover and verifiers (both on-chain and off-chain).

Theses implementations of prover and verifiers are in the [@sismo-core/hydra-s2](./package) npm package.

```sh
$ yarn add @sismo-core/hydra-s2
```

## Installation

- Install [Circom2](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/) (rust version)
- Build

```sh
$ yarn build
```

## Test

```sh
$ yarn test 
$ test:circuits
$ test:verifier-js
$ test:verifier-contract
$ test:prover-js
```
